# Joining our lab


### Joining as a Student / Research Assistant (Hiwi)

We hire students from relevant programs at UdS (e.g., LST, CS) as student assistants.
Student assistants in our lab are closely involved in research and often even lead their own projects and have published strong papers (e.g., at [ACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09963), [NeurIPS 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eV5YIrJPdy), [COLM 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00132), [NeurIPS 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21785)).
Please note that we expect applicants to have excellent programming skills, and strong grades in a relevant technical field (e.g., grades close to 1,0 in the German academic system; or strong GPAs from other countries).


### Joining  as a PhD Student

We offer fully funded PhD positions. As is typical in Europe, PhDs are expected to take 3-4 years. 
Our PhD students are affiliated with the [Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/). 
<!--For 2026 intake, please directly apply to our lab by email (please include CV, transcript, contact details of 2-3 references).-->
<!--, or via [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) and [ELIZA](https://eliza.school/).-->

Our lab is generously funded by a prestigious Emmy Noether grant from the German Research Foundation. We have plenty of compute resources by academic standards.
<!--PhD salaries start at approximately EUR 3.4K per month (before taxes) and increase over time.-->
<!--Start dates can be negotiated based on applicants' preferences and funding availability.-->

**Applicants who will have an MSc by the start date of the PhD:** Please directly apply to our lab by email. Admitted students will directly join our lab. Start dates are flexible and can be negotiated.
In your email to Michael (mhahn@lst.uni-saarland.de), please include:
* your CV
* your transcripts
* a brief statement explaining your motivation to apply to this position (please specifically refer to one or more recent publications from our group)
* contact details of 2 or 3 references.

For the current round of recruitment, applications received by **20 December 2025** will receive full consideration.
For your reference, you can find the legally binding call for the position [here](https://www.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/upload/verwaltung/stellen/Wissenschaftler/W2740.pdf).

**Aplicants without an MSc:** Applicants who only have an undergraduate degree should instead apply to the Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science, in which case the PhD includes an initial preparatory phase. If you're interested in working with me, please send me an email to confirm in advance.

<!--PhD applicants are generally expected to already have an MSc by the time the PhD starts; in this case they can directly join our lab. Applicants without an MSc s-->



### Joining as a Postdoc

The application process is the same as for PhD students.

### Joining  as an Intern

We take interns (undergraduate or graduate) around the year. If you’re an undergraduate from outside Germany, we may be able to provide housing but generally can’t pay a stipend. If you’re a graduate student, we might also be able to pay you.


### Which topics are we interested in?

As a member of our group, you'd have substantial freedom in choosing your research topic.
We are mostly interested in understanding the abilities, limitations, and inner workings of language models. 
You can take a look at our recent papers in NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and COLM to get a feel for the kind of work you might be doing with us.
