# Joining our lab

### Joining as a Student / Research Assistant (Hiwi)

We hire students from relevant programs at UdS (e.g., LST, CS) as student assistants.
Student assistants in our lab are closely involved in research and often even lead their own projects and have published strong papers (e.g., at [ACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09963), [NeurIPS 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eV5YIrJPdy), [COLM 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00132), [NeurIPS 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21785)).


### Joining  as a PhD Student

We offer fully funded PhD positions. As is typical in Europe, PhDs are expected to take 3-4 years. 
Our PhD students are affiliated with the [Saarbruecken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/). 
For 2026 intake, please directly apply to our lab by email (please include CV, transcript, contact details of 2-3 references).
<!--, or via [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) and [ELIZA](https://eliza.school/).-->

PhD applicants are generally expected to already have an MSc by the time the PhD starts; in this case they can directly join our lab. Applicants without an MSc should instead apply to the Saarbruecken Graduate School of Computer Science, in which case the PhD includes an initial preparatory phase.


### Joining  as an Intern

We take interns (undergraduate or graduate) around the year. If you’re an undergraduate from outside Germany, we may be able to provide housing but generally can’t pay a stipend. If you’re a graduate student, we might also be able to pay you.


### Which topics are we interested in?

We are mostly interested in understanding the abilities, limitations, and inner workings of language models. 
You can take a look at our recent papers in NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and COLM to get a feel for the kind of work you might be doing with us.


### Contact

We expect applicants to have excellent programming skills, and strong grades in a relevant technical field (e.g., grades close to 1,0 in the German academic system; or strong GPAs from other countries).

If you’re interested in joining, please send your CV and transcripts to Michael (mhahn@lst.uni-saarland.de).
