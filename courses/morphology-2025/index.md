# Processing Morphology

Morphology concerns linguistic structure within words; for example, "Handschuhe" can be broken down into the morphemes "hand", "shoe" and plural (-e). There is significant variation in morphological structure across languages: some have rich systems of inflection and derivation, while other languages barely use morphology at all. This seminar reviews how complex morphology is processed by humans and machines, with special attention to functional and information-theoretic accounts.

Key themes:

- Introduction to Morphological Processing: Morphology poses related but distinct research questions for linguists, psycholinguists, and computational modelers.
- Regularity and Generalization: Can we model morphological regularity and predict how speakers generalize?
- Complexity and Learning: How should we measure complexity in morphology? Do speakers and models learn more efficiently when morphology is less complex?
- Morphemes and Subword Tokens: How does morphology relate to common subword tokenization appraoches like BPE? Does subword tokenization make language model behavior less cognitively plausible?
- Modeling Morphological Fusion: A case study comparing Bayesian and information-theoretic approaches to *fusion*, the phenomenon whereby multiple morphological features (e.g. non-feminine, singular, genitive) are expressed by a single morpheme (e.g. "des Handschuh**s**").

**Time (block seminar):** 1-4 pm on Weds Feb 12, Monday Feb 17, Weds Feb 19, and Friday Feb 21. UPDATE: this may need to change

In addition, there will be an online introductory lecture + coordination session during Winter Semester. ~~Preliminary date, possibly subject to change: **January 13, 2025**.~~ **Finalized date: 3-5 pm, January 20, 2025.** Teams link to be sent out by email.

**Registration deadline**: January 31

**Room:** TBD


## Format and requirements

This is a block seminar course.

Every student will give a 30-minute presentation.

Students that do not present on a given day are expected to prepare a one- to two-page high-level overview which summarizes the day's assigned reading and explains how the papers relate to each other. The summary should conclude with a question for discussion. These summaries will be submitted by CMS at the start of each classroom session.


## Syllabus

**N.B.** Syllabus contents may be revised based on seminar participation. Syllabus and presentation assignments will be finalized by **Feb. 7.**

## Evaluation

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to check which versions (4CP or 7CP) your study program allows.

For students taking the seminar for 4 credits:

    Presentation: 50%
    Reading summaries: 50%

For students taking the seminar for 7 credits:

    Presentation: 25%
    Reading summaries: 25%
    Final report: 50%

### Reading Summaries

You are expected to upload a short reading summary to the CMS on days that you do not present. Please see the introduction session slides for more details on the format.

### Presentations

Given time limitations, presentations will be strictly kept to 30 minutes each, followed by a break and then a general discussion covering all of the papers. The presentation should focus on high-level points from the readings, such as the main argument and evidence for and against key claims under consideration.


### Term Papers

You will write a 6 page report (ACL format). See introduction session slides for more details.

The report should be uploaded via CMS. The due date will be one month following our final in-person session.
