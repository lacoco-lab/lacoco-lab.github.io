# Processing Morphology

Morphology concerns linguistic structure within words; for example, "Handschuhe" can be broken down into the morphemes "hand", "shoe" and plural (-e). There is significant variation in morphological structure across languages: some have rich systems of inflection and derivation, while other languages barely use morphology at all. In light of this, we might ask: why have complex morphology at all? This seminar reviews how complex morphology is processed by humans and machines, with special attention to functional and information-theoretic accounts.

## Format and requirements

This is a block seminar course.

Every student will give a 30-minute presentation.

Students that do not present on a given day are expected to prepare a two-page high-level overview which summarizes the day's assigned reading and explains how the papers relate to each other. The summary should conclude with a question for discussion. These summaries will be submitted by CMS at the start of each classroom session.


## Syllabus

TBD


## Evaluation

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to check which versions (4CP or 7CP) your study program allows.

For students taking the seminar for 4 credits:

    Presentation: 50%
    Reading summaries: 50%

For students taking the seminar for 7 credits:

    Presentation: 25%
    Reading summaries: 25%
    Final report: 50%


### Presentations

Given time limitations, presentations will be strictly kept to 30 minutes each, followed by a break and then a general discussion covering all of the papers. The presentation should focus on high-level points from the readings, such as the main argument and evidence for and against key claims under consideration.


### Term Papers

You will write a 6 page report (ACL format). Details TBD.

The report should be uploaded via CMS. The due date will be one month following our final in-person session.
