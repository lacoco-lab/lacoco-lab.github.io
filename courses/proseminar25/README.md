# Proseminar (Introductory Seminar): Large Language Models

## Data

This proseminar is organized by: Prof. Dr. Michael Hahn

When and where: Do 12:15â€“13:45, Raum -1.05 (Building C7.2)

The class is centered around Jurasfky & Martin [J&M] (3rd edition): https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/

Specifically, the January 25 version: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_Jan25.pdf

Please register in Course Maganement System (CMS): https://cms.sic.saarland/prposeminar_llms_25/
We will use this for announcements and other communication.

The course is aimed primarily at students of B.Sc. Computerlinguistik in the second semester.

The number of participants is limited to 20. Please note that registration in CMS does not guarantee that you will be admitted. Admission will be finalized in the first week of the semester.

Every participant is expected to attend all sessions. Please let Michael know if you cannot attend some session. Attendance is important because in-class discussion is a substantive component of this proseminar.

The couse is worth 5CP. Every participant gives a presentation and submits a term paper.

Every presentation just covers a few pages of the J&M book, but contains a lot of technical content. A key component of your presentation will be to take technical content from the J&M book, thoroughly understand it, and present it in a form that makes it understandable to the other seminar participants. Thorough understanding of your topic is a key aspect; be prepared to invest a substantial amount of effort into understanding the technical details of your assigned part of the book. Besides giving a good presentation, you should be prepared to answer questions from seminar participants and Michael.

You should view the assigned part of the book just as a starting point, and are highly encouraged to draw on other resources beyond the J&M book (scholarly resources such as those referenced in the J&M book - but also blog posts, videos etc) to deepen your understanding of your topic. Your presentation should clearly indicate which resources you drew on.
