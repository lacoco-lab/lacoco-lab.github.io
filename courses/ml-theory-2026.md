# Theory of Machine Learning

## Material

We will treat a selection of material from [Tengyu Ma's lecture notes](https://github.com/tengyuma/cs229m_notes/blob/main/master.pdf) from [CS229M at Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/stats214/) (see also [this iteration](https://tselilschramm.org/mltheory/stats214-fall24.html)).

We'll also take a view towards Transformers/LLMs, based on TODO.
